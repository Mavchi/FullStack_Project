The 2-in-1 Kettlebell Leg Workout
Workout One: STRENGTH
If your priorities are brute strength and muscle growth, 
complete three to five rounds of this routine with two 
minutes of rest between exercises to facilitate effective 
recovery.
  Beginner athletes: Perform five repetitions per exercise.
  Intermediate to advanced athletes: Perform 8-12 repetitions.
	Exercise One: Kettlebell Deadlift
	Exercise Two: Kettlebell High Pull to Squat
	Exercise Three: Two-Handed Swing
	Exercise Four: Threaded Kettlebell Lunge
	Exercise Five: Traveling Swings Forward
	Exercise Six: Traveling Swings Backward
	Exercise Seven: Side-Stepping Swings
Workout Two: CONDITIONING
Take a look at the exercises below. Look familiar? They 
should: If you’re looking to develop high levels of 
muscular endurance and stamina, the same exercises as the 
strength complex can easily become a conditioning complex. 
The only difference? This time, you’re aiming to complete 
as many rounds as possible in 20 minutes. Just be sure to 
use a lighter kettlebell—you’ll be doing far more volume, 
so it’s only natural to use weight you can handle for far 
more reps.
	Beginner athletes: Perform 5 repetitions per exercise.
	Intermediate to advanced athletes: perform 8-12 repetitions.
